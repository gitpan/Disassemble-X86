Disassemble::X86 version 0.10
=============================


This module disassembles Intel x86 (IA32) machine code into a readable
text format. It understands both 16- and 32-bit code, as well as MMX,
SSE, SSE2, and 3DNow! extensions.


Why not just use objdump/ndisasm/etc?

With this module, you retain control during the disassembly process.
For instance, if a jump instruction is disassembled, you can start
disassembling from the target address immediately. This helps avoid
getting out of sync with the instruction stream.


INSTALLATION
